## Description

- My motivation behind building this project was to get myself more familiar with HTML and CSS, more specifically with organizing them.
- I build this project to make sure the code was structured in a neat order, and that everything was legible and understandable.
- It solved the problem of not seeing an organized code structure.
- I learned how to look into the code and determine which parts of the code are supposed to go in order to keep them organized.
